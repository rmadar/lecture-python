    "A random walk (or \"drunk man walk\") describes the motion of an object in space, as a serie of steps where each step is done randomely. This type of random process appears in many physical systems (*e.g.* brownian motion) and have some universal properties which can be studied. In this exam, we propose to simulate a random walk in two dimensions and numerically study some of their properties. To better understand, you can imagine a random walk at one dimension : at each iteration of the walk (a step), the stystem randomely moves to the right (forward, step of $+1$) or to the left (backward, step of $-1$).\n",

    "### Exam organisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is organized in three parts, starting beforehand with two short questions on the lecture itself. The goal of the first part is to implement the simulation of a 2D random walk, in pure python first and then exploiting numpy. The second part and third parts are devoted to the study of individual and collective properties of random walks. Finally, there is a bonus part related to a modified random walk (to be not that random).\n",
