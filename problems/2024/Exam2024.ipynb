    "### Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam proposes to analyze data describing the 2D motion of a system of two bees, in different situations. These data were generated by a numerical simulation with tunable parameters, such as an attraction force between the two bees, the presence of a field of flowers (attracting the bees too), or some random noise in the trajectory of each bees. More precisely, the following parameters will be considered:\n",
    " + `BOX`       : if enabled, there is a box (*i.e.* a limited area) in which the bees can live (bees are simply reflected when hiting a wall of the box)\n",
    " + `LBOX`      : length of the box, which is chosen to be a square\n",
    " + `ATTRACTION`: if enabled, bees attract each other (spring force)\n",
    " + `g_ATTRA`   : strenght of the mutual attraction\n",
    " + `FIELD`     : if enabled, there is a field of flowers organised on a regular lattice\n",
    " + `g_FIELD`   : strengh of individual flower attraction\n",
    " + `NOISE`     : if enabled, some random noise is added in individual bee trajectories\n",
    " \n",
    "*N.B.* For this exam, there is no need to know the exact mathematical definition of these coefficients, or the exact equations describing the various forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains the following variables:\n",
    " + time (in ms) : `tms`\n",
    " + x-position of bee 1 and bee 2: `Rx1` and `Rx2`\n",
    " + y-position of bee 1 and bee 2: `Ry1` and `Ry2`\n",
    " + x- and y- velocities of bee 1 and bee 2 : `Vx1`, `Vx2`, `Vy1`, `Vy2`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exam organisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of the exam proposes to study data that were already generated, while the second part of the exam focuses on data generation using an external module, in order to see how the model parameters affect the system.\n",
