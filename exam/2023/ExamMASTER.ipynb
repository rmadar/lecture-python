    "Least action principle is a formalism which offers an alternative way to describe laws of mechanics, namely the fundamental principle of dynamics, as known as Newtow second's law. The basic idea is a classical system will evolve such that the trajectory $\\vec{r}(t)$ minimizes a certain quantity, called *action*. In addition, the quantum mechanics can naturally be derived from the least action principle, assuming that *all trajectories are explored by the system*. If, after the exam, you want to read a bit more about this, you can read [the Feynman lectures on this topic](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_19.html).\n",

The second section proposes to develop a numerical method to compute integrals and quantify the precision of the numerical result. A third *bonus* section presents the computation the action for an actual physical problem.\n",
