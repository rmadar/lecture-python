    "> The final mark will be a number between 0 (very bad) and 20 (very good). The evaluation of this exam takes into account mainly the correctness of the answers, but also the clarity of the explanations and the quality of the code. *There is no required knowledge about coupled oscillators to answer the questions asked in this exam.*"

    "The dynamic of harmonic oscillators is almost everywhere in physics, from the simple pendulum to wave propagation, including quantum field theory describing elementary particles and their interactions. The only needed information about an oscillator is that it is described by a single variable varying with time (one can think about an angle of a pendulum or the height of hanging mass to a spring). In the following this coordinate will be written $r_i(t)$ for the $i^{th}$ oscillator and $v_i(t)$ is defined as the velocity of the oscillator: $v_i(t) \\equiv \\mathrm{d}r_i/\\mathrm{d}t$.\n",

    "### Data format\n",
    "\n",
    "For N oscillators described for $n$ times values, the data to be analyzed are provided in the `csv` format with $2N+1$ columns and $n$ lines. The first column is the value of the time in second, the second column is the position of the first oscillator $r_1$, the third column is the velocity of the first oscillator $v_1$, etc ...\n",

    "### Exam organisation\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam proposes few studies of harmonic oscillators, organized into two parts. The first part is dedicated to a system of two coupled oscillators while the second part focuses on a vibrating string dynamic. But before these two part, some questions on the lectures are proposed. A bonus question can be done at the end if time allows.\n",
